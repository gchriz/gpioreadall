# Simple clone of wiringPi's 'gpio readall'

Since wiringPi is no longer developed (see http://wiringpi.com/news)
and is not contained in Raspberry Pi OS version Bullseye any more
the command 'gpio' is gone.

And so the really helpfull 'gpio readall' too.

This simple Python script here aims to give a similar output.

It has been tested with a Raspberry Pi version 2B and a Pi400 yet.

No warranties at all - as usual.

Comments and suggestions are welcome.
